# Machine Learning M.Sc.

This repository contains all the assignments of the M.Sc. Machine Learning course in Computer Science at University of Athens. These assignments cover a broad area of Machine Learning techniques, from simple regression problems to applying deep learning algorithms.

### Linear Regression (Assignment 1)

This [notebook](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/blob/main/linear_regression/linear_regression.ipynb) contains a "from scratch" implementation of a multiple linear regressor. The task was to predict values using the Boston Housing dataset.

### Naive Bayes - Ridge Regression (Assignment 2)

This [notebook](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/blob/main/naive_bayes_and_regularization/naive_bayes.ipynb) contains a "from scratch" implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier in order to classify datapoints into 2 different classes. The dataset that was used can be found [here](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/tree/main/naive_bayes_and_regularization/datasets/nb)

Also, the second part, which is implemented in this [notebook](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/blob/main/naive_bayes_and_regularization/ridge_regression.ipynb), was about implementing from scratch again, a ridge regressor and make comparisons with the previously implemented linear regresson

### KMeans - SVM (Assignment 3)

This [notebook](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/blob/main/kmeans_svm/kmeans.ipynb) contains a "from scratch" implementation of KMeans clustering algorithm. The implemented KMeans supports 2 types of initialization; random and kmeans++. Additionally, in this [notebook](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/blob/main/kmeans_svm/svm.ipynb) using Scikit Learn's SVM implementation, contains some experiments in order to classify the data points of the MNIST-784 dataset.

### Deep Learning (Assignment 4)

In this final assignment, using the Pytorch library we have to implement two types of Neural Networks, a fully connected and a convolutional. The related notebooks can be found here: [simple_nn](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/blob/main/deep_neural_networks/nn.ipynb), [convolutional_nn](https://github.com/VangelisTsiatouras/machine-learning-msc/blob/main/deep_neural_networks/cnn.ipynb). The task was to make efficient neural networks that classify the images of CIFAR-10 dataset and make comparisons between the two different types of networks.
